An N body simulation is a calculation of the physical motion of massive bodies that all exert forces on each other. One example is asteroids in an asteroid field, which all exert gravitational forces on each other. This problem is interesting because it is a chaotic system for systems involving at least three bodies, which means you can't write down an equation that will predict the motion of the bodies, and you have to use numerical methods. This chaotic behavior leads to mesmerizing animations.
